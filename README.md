****Real-Time Data Extraction and Machine Learning for Optimized UberRide Booking**

 **Overview**
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict Uber ride fares based on various features extracted from ride data. Additionally, it includes a Streamlit web application that allows users to input ride details and get fare estimates.


**Skills Acquired**
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Feature Engineering
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Regression Modeling
Hyperparameter Tuning
Model Evaluation
Geospatial Analysis
Time Series Analysis
Web Application Development with Streamlit
Deployment on Cloud Platforms (AWS)

**Domain**
Transportation, Data Science, Machine Learning, Web Development

**Approach**
Upload Dataset: Upload the dataset to an S3 bucket. 
Data Retrieval: Retrieve the data from the S3 bucket. 
Data Preprocessing: Apply preprocessing techniques including handling null values and dtype conversion. 
Cloud Storage: Push the cleaned data to an RDS server (MySQL) cloud database. 
Data Retrieval from Cloud: Retrieve the cleaned data from the cloud server. 
Model Training: Train the machine learning model and save it.
Application Development: Create an application for the saved model. 
User Interface: Develop a user interface for input and prediction

**Results**
Trained Model: A regression model capable of accurately predicting Uber ride fares. 
Web Application: A functional Streamlit app for getting fare estimates based on ride details. 
Evaluation Metrics: Detailed performance metrics for the regression model. 

**Dataset**
Source: Uber ride data (CSV format) 
Variables: key, fare_amount, pickup_datetime, pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude, dropoff_longitude, dropoff_latitude, passenger_count
Content: Contains details of Uber rides, including fare amount, pickup/dropoff locations, ride datetime, and number of passengers.


**Project Deliverables**
Source Code: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and the Streamlit app. 
Documentation: A detailed report explaining data analysis, model development, and deployment. 
Web Application: Deployed Streamlit app accessible via a URL. 

**Project Guidelines**
Coding Standards: Follow PEP 8 guidelines.
Version Control: Use Git for version control. Commit changes regularly. 
Documentation: Ensure code is well-commented and provide clear instructions for running scripts and the application.
Best Practices: Validate models with cross-validation, ensure reproducibility, and handle data privacy appropriately
